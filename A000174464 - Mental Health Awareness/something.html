    <p><strong>Background/Purpose of the Brief</strong>: Our team has chosen The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) charity as our philanthropic area because we believe there is an urgent need to improve care and services provided to those living with mental health issues across Canada. We have identified a gap within this sector that needs addressing and we believe that with innovative thinking and creative solutions, this gap can be filled. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Overall Charitable Landscape</strong>: According to the Canada Revenue Agency (2020), Canadians gave $11.19 billion in donations in 2018, a 5% decrease from 2017. The largest amount of donations were given to “humanitarian aid” causes at 32%, followed by health care/hospitals at 21%. Mental health charities such as CAMH only accounted for 4% of total donations made in 2018.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your Charity (NFP) Analysis:</strong></p> 

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Charitable Description:</strong> The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) is Canada’s largest mental health teaching hospital and one of the world's leading research centers in its field. Their mission is to provide compassionate care and services while advancing knowledge and promoting understanding about mental health.</li>

      <li><strong>Donations: </strong></liAccording to CAMH’s Annual Report (2019), donations have increased over the past 5 years, from $5.5 million in 2014 to $11.2 million in 2019. This indicates that donation levels are growing and awareness of their cause is increasing.</p>

	  <li><strong>The Situation Analysis:</strong>
	   <ul> 
	     <li><strong>Past: </strong>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health has been providing care and services to those living with mental health issues since its founding in 1998. Over the years, they have made great strides in advancing knowledge and promoting understanding about mental illness through research initiatives, public education campaigns, treatment programs, etc. However, there is still a long way to go before mental health is fully accepted by society and those living with mental illness are given the respect and support they deserve.</li>

         <li><strong>Present: </strong></pCAMH is currently working to improve access to care and services for those living with mental health issues through various initiatives such as their Mental Health Strategic Plan, which outlines a five-year plan for improving care across Canada (CAMH, 2019). They are also working to reduce stigma around mental health by engaging the public in conversations about the issue through campaigns such as #MyMentalHealthMatters (CAMH, 2020).</li>

         <li><strong>Future: </strong></pThe ideal solution would be for all Canadians to have equal access to quality mental health care and services. This would involve more funding from both government and private sources, greater awareness of the issue, improved treatment options, and more support for those living with mental illness.</li>
	   </ul> 
      </li>
	  
	  <li><strong>Potential Obstacles:</strong> The main obstacle to achieving this goal is the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health, which leads to a lack of understanding and acceptance of the issue. This in turn leads to less funding from both government and private sources, as well as fewer resources and services available for those living with mental health issues. Additionally, many people are not aware of the available treatment options or where to access them.</li>

      <li><strong>Target Audience: </strong></pOur idea/improvement is aimed at all Canadians; however, our primary target audience would be those aged 55-64, who are most likely to donate (Canada Revenue Agency, 2020). We also need to convince governments and other organizations that providing greater support for mental health is essential and that more funding needs to be allocated to this cause. Once implemented, our idea would impact those living with mental illness by providing them with greater access to care and resources.</li>
	</ul>

    <p><strong>Competitive Considerations: </strong></pThe main competitors within the donation sphere are other charities and organizations that provide services related to mental health such as The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), which provides education, advocacy, and support for those living with mental illness (Canadian Mental Health Association, 2020). Other competitors include hospitals, universities, research institutions, etc., all of which are vying for donations from the same pool of potential donors. 
	There are also competitive ideas in terms of how these organizations market themselves; some may focus on their research initiatives while others may focus on their treatment programs. Furthermore, the way in which they engage with potential donors also varies; some may use traditional methods such as mail campaigns while others may use digital platforms such as social media.

    <p><strong>The Creative Challenge:</strong></p>The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of support and resources available for those living with mental health issues across Canada. We believe that there is a need for greater awareness of this issue and more funding from both government and private sources in order to provide better access to care and services. We also believe that innovative thinking and creative solutions can help fill this gap by engaging the public in conversations about mental health, increasing donations to organizations such as CAMH, and improving treatment options. 
	The value that would be created by doing something new is increased awareness and understanding of mental health, which in turn leads to greater acceptance and support for those living with it. Furthermore, the implementation of innovative solutions could lead to more resources being allocated to this cause and improved access to care for those who need it most.

    <p><strong>Summary of Recommendations:</strong></p>Our team has identified five creative recommendations that we believe will help address the gap within the charitable/NFP arena related to mental health:
	<ul>
	  <li>Develop a comprehensive public education campaign aimed at increasing awareness about mental health issues and reducing stigma surrounding them. This can include both traditional methods such as television commercials as well as digital platforms such as social media campaigns;</li>

      <li>Establish a grant program for mental health research initiatives that will help advance knowledge and promote understanding about this issue;</li>

      <li>Increase funding from both government and private sources in order to provide better access to care and services for those living with mental illness;</li>

      <li>Create an online platform that allows potential donors to easily search for charities related to mental health and make donations quickly and securely;</li>

	  <il>Develop partnerships with other organizations such as universities, hospitals, etc., in order to increase awareness of the issue.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The net impression we want to achieve after launching our recommendations is increased support for those living with mental health issues. We want people to be more aware of the available resources, treatment options, etc., so they can get the help they need. We also want to create a more accepting and understanding environment for those living with mental illness so that they can live their lives without fear of judgement or discrimination.</p>
