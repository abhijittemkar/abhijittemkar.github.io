I have created a GitHub repository for hosting the website thats why the names of the files would be little different and in different locations.

Main HTML file -- Index.html
(All the other sub webpages would be in the same folder)

CSS file - /assets/css/main.css
Javascript file - assets/js/main.js


Website can be accessed from here :
https://abhijittemkar.github.io/A000174464%20-%20Mental%20Health%20Awareness/index.html


Thank You!
